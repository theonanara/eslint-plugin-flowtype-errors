# How to Use Cytomic The Glue to Enhance Your Mixes
 
Cytomic The Glue is a powerful compressor plug-in that emulates the sound and behavior of the legendary SSL 4000 buss compressor. It can add punch, glue, and warmth to your mixes, as well as provide some creative effects. In this article, we will show you how to use Cytomic The Glue to enhance your mixes in different scenarios.
 
## What is Cytomic The Glue?
 
Cytomic The Glue is an analog modeled compressor plug-in based on The classic 80's British big console buss compressor with some handy additional features[^1^] [^2^]. It uses the same high quality algorithms used in circuit simulators, but optimised to run fast, and features a gorgeous fully scalable user interface[^1^] [^2^].

Cytomic The Glue has a simple and intuitive interface that lets you adjust the following parameters:
 
- Threshold: The level at which the compression starts to kick in.
- Ratio: The amount of compression applied once the threshold is exceeded.
- Attack: The speed at which the compressor reacts to the incoming signal.
- Release: The speed at which the compressor returns to its normal state after the signal drops below the threshold.
- Makeup: The amount of gain added to the output signal to compensate for the volume reduction caused by compression.
- Range: The maximum amount of gain reduction applied by the compressor.
- Mix: The balance between the dry (uncompressed) and wet (compressed) signals.
- Sidechain: A switch that lets you choose between internal or external sidechain sources for triggering the compression.
- Peak Clip In: A switch that lets you apply a soft clipping distortion to the input signal before compression.
- Peak Clip Out: A switch that lets you apply a soft clipping distortion to the output signal after compression.

Cytomic The Glue also has a large VU meter that shows the amount of gain reduction applied by the compressor, as well as a bypass switch and an oversampling option.
 
## How to Use Cytomic The Glue on Drums
 
Cytomic The Glue can be used on individual drum tracks or on a drum buss to add punch, cohesion, and groove to your drums. Here are some tips on how to use Cytomic The Glue on drums:

- Set a low threshold and a high ratio to apply a strong compression to your drums. This will make them sound more consistent and powerful.
- Adjust the attack and release times according to the tempo and feel of your song. A fast attack will make your drums sound tighter and snappier, while a slow attack will let some of the initial transients pass through and make your drums sound more dynamic and natural. A fast release will make your drums sound more aggressive and energetic, while a slow release will make them sound more smooth and relaxed.
- Use the makeup gain to bring up the level of your drums after compression. You can also use the peak clip in or out switches to add some subtle distortion and saturation to your drums for more character and warmth.
- Use the mix knob to blend in some of the dry signal with the compressed signal. This will preserve some of the original dynamics and punch of your drums while still benefiting from the compression effect.
- Use the sidechain switch to select an external sidechain source for triggering the compression. This can be useful if you want to duck your drums in sync with another element in your mix, such as a bassline or a vocal. You can also use an EQ or a filter on your sidechain source to fine-tune which frequencies affect the compression.

## How to Use Cytomic The Glue on Vocals
 
Cytomic The Glue can be used on vocal tracks or on a vocal buss to add smoothness, clarity, and presence to your vocals. Here are some tips on how to use Cytomic The Glue on vocals:

- Set a moderate threshold and ratio to apply a gentle compression to your 8cf37b1e13
